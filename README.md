#Full CRUD Full Stack App

- Use Express to build a server
- Use Mongoose to communicate with MongoDB 
- Full CRUD functionality on our fruits resource
- User Authentication
- The ability to add comments to fruits
- (Maybe gather data from a 3rd party API)

This app will start as an API, that receives request and sends
JSON responses, but eventually we will add a views layer
that will render html
